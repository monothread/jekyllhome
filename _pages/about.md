I'm a software engineer currently cooking stuff in the .NET kitchen at [Epiroc](https://www.epiroc.com/).

My primary responsibilities involve backend development. This includes building distributed systems based on client-server architecture, developing web and gRPC APIs, managing SQL databases, and some occasional Python scripting and gluing.

Previously, I worked on embedded systems at the same company, where I did both frontend and backend work in C++ as well as automated testing using Python and Pytest.

Prior to this, I was an Infrastructure Site Reliability Engineer at [King](https://www.king.com/), and before that I was a Telecom Services Operations Engineer at [Tele2](https://www.tele2.se/).
