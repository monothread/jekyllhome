I'm currently working as a contractor developing and improving embedded systems at [Epiroc](https://www.epiroc.com/), where I do both frontend and backend work in C++, as well as automated testing using Python and Pytest.

Prior to this I was a Site Reliability Engineer at [King](https://www.king.com/), and before that I was an Operations Eningeer at [Tele2](https://www.tele2.se/).

I hold a bachelors degree in computer science from Ã–rebro Universitet here in Sweden, where I combined my studies with a part time job as a Network Operations Engineer at [Telenor](https://www.telenor.se/).
