I'm a software engineer currently cooking stuff in the .NET kitchen at [Epiroc](https://www.epiroc.com/). I mostly do backend related tasks like developing distributed client server architecture systems, Web and gRPC API's etc. I do some UI related stuff as well, which mostly revolves around utilizing predefined UI components.

Before this, I worked on embedded systems at the same company, where I did both frontend and backend work in C++, as well as automated testing using Python and Pytest.

Prior to this, I was an Infrastructure Site Reliability Engineer at [King](https://www.king.com/), and before that I was a Telecom Services Operations Engineer at [Tele2](https://www.tele2.se/).
